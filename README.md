# DSA Practice with TypeScript

This repo contains my daily DSA practice using TypeScript. Each day I solve 2–3 problems and maintain logs.

## 📁 Structure

- `day-XX/`: Daily practice problems and solutions
- `data-structures/`: Custom implementations like Stack, Queue, Linked List
- `algorithms/`: Common algorithms like Sorting and Searching
- `utils/`: Helpers and test runners

## 🔥 Goal
Build strong DSA foundations and improve problem-solving skills in TypeScript/JavaScript.
