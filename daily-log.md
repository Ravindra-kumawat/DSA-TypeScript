### ðŸ“… Day 01 â€“ `reverseString`

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Topic:** String manipulation â€“ reverse a string  
**Problem Link:** [GFG- Reverse String](https:***.com)  

---

#### âœ… What I Practiced:
- Solved the `reverseString` problem in multiple ways:
  1. Using Built-in reverse() method
  2. Using a manual `for` loop
  3. Using Built-in reduce method
  4. Using a Two-Pointer (Swapping) Technique
  5. Using recursion

---

#### ðŸ§  What I Learned:
- Explored different techniques to reverse a string in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Compared performance and readability of each method.
- Improved confidence with strings, loops, reduce and recursion.
- Practiced writing clear code with JSDoc comments.
